            <h3>Post-Activity Reflection</h3>
            <p>The flexbox layout supports different users through its ability to be displayed on desktop or mobile
                fairly easily, adjusting for the dimension of the viewing window. For users having to actively click to
                reveal information, this means that mobile users may benefit more from this feature. Some mobile users might
                not want to be bombarded with lots of information as soon as they open the site, and only expand sections
                that are relevant to them. For users accessing the site on their computer, they might prefer to see all
                information all at once since they have the screen space for it.
            </p>
            <p>The act of hiding and revealing content allows more user autonomy or designer control based on the scenario.
                For example, a designer could be purposefully hiding content from users or making it more difficult to access,
                in which it would be more in the designer's control. Another example or view is that users have the ability to
                customize" their own experience on the site by choosing what content to view and when - they are in control
                of their journey through the site. This subject is a double-edged sword in that way. Features like this
                exclude people from a site or allow users more control over the content that they see, reducing their
                cognitive load.
