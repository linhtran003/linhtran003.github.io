    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Hi! I’m Linh and I am a Colorado native. I’m currently a senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring 
            in CTD and Computer Engineering. I spend most of my time studying/working and spending time with friends and family.</p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <div>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy watching TV and movies, spending time with friends and family, crocheting/looming.
            In my school and professional work, I enjoy software development - I have some experience with developing web and desktop applications from my previous internships.
            UI/UX design also interests me, which is why I was very interested in taking some of the classes in CTD.
        </p>
